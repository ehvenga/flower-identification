# Flower Species Classification using TensorFlow

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify flower species from images. The model is built using TensorFlow and covers the complete workflow from data preprocessing to model training and performance evaluation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-classification.git

jupyter notebook Flower_Classification.ipynb

```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook includes various flower species and is preprocessed for optimal model training performance.

## Model

The CNN architecture defined in the notebook is structured to efficiently learn the distinguishing features of different flower species based on their images.

## Evaluation

The notebook includes sections for evaluating the model's accuracy on test data, providing insights into its performance.
